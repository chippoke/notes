# Gateway

A Gateway in this system refers to some sort of external, public-facing
interface, like a Discord bot or website.

## Notes

- Needs a standardized method of translation between the system it integrates
  with and the API server.
- Needs to be able to authenticate with the API server in a similar fashion to
  the services, as it is essentially a service that receives data from outside the API.
